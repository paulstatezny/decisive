## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

### Building the App

You'll need the latest NPM, as well as familiarity with running commands from the terminal.

1. Clone the repo.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`; a development server will start and the app will be accessible on `http://localhost:9000`.
1. Make any changes, and they'll be reflected in real time with React Hot Loader.

### Making Contributions

Contributions are always welcome. If you find a missing feature or bug, feel free to open a Pull Request. Be patient while core contributors find the time to review your code, and don't be surprised if you're asked to make changes.
